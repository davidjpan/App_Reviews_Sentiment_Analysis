# App_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_Random_Forests

This project examines 5000 most relevant google play store reviews for Macy's Android app. This project mainly focuses on text mining and machine learning techniques. 

In this analysis, I used two datasets containing good and bad reviews for the app, respectively. Reviews above (including) three stars are considered good; those below are considered bad. The reviews are scraped using macys_text_mining. Word frequencies are analyzed in macys_analysis, and finally machine learning algorithm is carried out in macys_classifier.

19	Rated 2 stars out of five stars	Too many updates. This app alone is taking too much storage space. I for see having to delete the app.
22	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	"App said get 25% off my purchase. I get that my suit was on sale so the 25% wouldn't work on top of the sale but I figured it would be an equal trade since I've given the store the ability to take my money straight from my phone. Well check out time comes and they tried to add a tax to my purchase. ...

32	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	here we go again.. star rewards are constantly pending..called waited 20 mins. they said it would be fixed in a couple of days, that was 7 days ago. So the rewards are basically gone, if that's why you shop especially during double days...beware...no one is helping with this problem.
37	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	If you need to use the app to make payments on your credit card you're going to be disappointed. The last 3 times (months) I tried, the screen just goes blank. I loaded it specifically for this purpose because I can use fingerprint login. Very disappointing.
39	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	I downloaded the app so I could use the 25% off offer, but at checkout, it keeps giving me an error message to add a shipping address even though it's already in my account settings. Plus I was trying to do a pickup in store anyways so I don't know why the app is asking for a shipping address.
40	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	Promised 25% off disappears after signing up so this company is duping the public. I usually never get apps like these for shopping but I took a chance on this for the discount to see if I like it. only issue is that the discount never comes so they just want your info.
43	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	Stopped showing product images. I love the app, I use it a lot, but since February or March started having that problem and now I have to go to the web page. I uninstalled the app around 4 weeks ago and installed again today and the problem remains.
45	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	"The only reason I shop this app is that returns are easy and there are great sales.

53	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	since updating there are no product photos, I cant enter promos, descriptions are cut off, cant see past purchases, freezes.... generally sucks! ive uninstalled and reinstalled 4 times to no avail.

57	Rated 2 stars out of five stars	very inconsistent. can do price checks but sometimes even the price is not accurate to with the store price is. always having to close the app or it will force close itself. needs a lot of work. able to check my card balance but that's about the best thing about it.
59	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	its better to go to their website to order. This app is not working properly. I forgot my password so I put in my sign in account ( correctly) and click on ' forgot password'. I never get sent any email to reset my password. This is my third and last attempt.
60	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	All smoke & mirrors. They offer you 25% off with your first app order but there are so many excluded items that the only things you'll get 25% off of is some really obscure full priced items. Uninstalling app.

156	Rated 2 stars out of five stars	Pictures still don't display for items while browsing and in orders. Everything else is super slow to load. The app was great months ago, making it easy to shop frequently. I haven't been able to use it in a couple of months.
167	Rated 2 stars out of five stars	I made an online purchase before I downloaded the app. There is nowhere in the app (that I've found) to enter an order number to track its progress.

2208	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	Hey macys. Please take some time and develop an app that is compatible with tablets. Is very uncomfortable to be forced to switch to portrait mode. In the end where is the Magic in that?.
2209	Rated 2 stars out of five stars	Very poor quality. Scrolling barely works, clicks are registered in the wrong places, and some links can't be clicked at all! The app is also extremely slow and full of an excessive amount of popups. I had to close about 5 popups before I could get to my Macy's card statement.
2211	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	Requiring a Macy's account to get initial app user savings keeps me from buying this way. I'm a loyal shopper, but I only use one credit card for all my shopping. Too bad, I lost the Macy's card in my divorce.
2214	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	This app is unreliable. I always get an email 2 hours later saying my order was canceled. I have to call their customer service to confirm the purchase. What a waste of time!
2218	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	Don't waste your time every order is canceled and you have to call customer service to verify your account, i put up with this BS for months and they couldn't give me a reason why ,they said they do it to everyone , no thanks you're not doing me any favors F off ! MACY'S

2234	Rated 2 stars out of five stars	Frequently have problems with valid password not being accepted. I make a new password and get into the site. Next time, same problem. Never have this happen with any other site
2241	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	App is not responsive and when I finished shopping and went to check out it said there was technical difficulties. I called the phone number and no one was available. I would avoid the app.
2246	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	filters dont work, very slow
2253	Rated 2 stars out of five stars	This app is kind of pointless if your dont have a amex/macys card because you wont be able to use the app to it's full extent like paying bills online. Makes no sense when they offer paperless statements when you cant add a regular card to view a statement or pay a bill.
2254	Rated 2 stars out of five stars	It used to be OK...until lately I have the hardest time placing an order...I used to buy at least twice a month but now its just impossible...I thought is was my phone but reading the reviews I have noticed I'm not the only one having problems...

2309	Rated 1 stars out of five stars	My first online purchase with Macy's & opened an account or at least tried to. Got in touch with someone & she didn't help at all. I'm disabled & needed some dress shoes for my great nieces wedding soon. I WAS NOT A HAPPY PERSON AT ALL & WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM EVER. VERY RUDE.
